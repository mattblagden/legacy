# JSurly

JSurly is a static-typing system for JavaScript. JSurly enforces some basic code-formatting rules that allow it to carry out 100% static typing without the need for explicit type declarations on each variable. The latest version of JSurly, along with all the documentation, can be found at [jsur.ly](http://jsur.ly).

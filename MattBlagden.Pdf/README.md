# PDF

A library for generation and manipulation of portable document foramt files.

Documents can be created by assembling a hierarchy of objects representing each element in the PDF format.

Existing documents can also be manipulated directly using the fully-parsed object hierarchy, or by using higher-level tools to reflow text and relocate drawing elements.

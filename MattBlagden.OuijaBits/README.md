OuijaBits is a server that periodically pulls the latest blocks from the Bitcoin network and tracks all unspent "normal" transactions (coins protected by a single key). This data can then be queried by clients.

The project includes both a commandline client and a web client. Each client allows users to input keys and see how many Bitcoins are unlocked by the key.
